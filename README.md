Case Study: Restaurant Information System
The Relaxing Koala is a café/restaurant on Glenferrie Road that has recently acquired the next-door property in order to expand its business. From a capacity of
about 50 people, the expansion will now allow the Relaxing Koala to host approximately 150 customers.
The day-to-day operations of the Relaxing Koala were so far organized in a very low-tech, mostly manual fashion, in particular on taking orders from guests, passing the
orders on to the kitchen, accounting etc. The owners of the Relaxing Koala, however, realise that the way the staff was working until now would not scale to the
new capacity of the café/restaurant. Therefore, they are thinking of introducing an information system to assist in their daily operations.
Having talked to a number of restaurants of a similar size, the owners devised an initial set of ideas of what processes they would like to have covered with the new
information system. In particular, the new system shall support reservations, taking orders from customers, informing the kitchen about these orders, creating invoices
and receipts for customers, and handling payments. In order to get a better overview of the kind of menu items the customers are ordering, the new system shall also
support basic statistics about ordered menu items etc. The owners also want to make the menus available online in order to better inform potential customers about
the offerings of the Relaxing Koala and to allow customers to order from the take- away menus and possibly arrange delivery.
Other restaurants incorporated further features into their information system. The owners of the Relaxing Koala, however, decided not to consider any of these
features for now, but this may be an option in the future.
In order to facilitate a tender process, the owners of the Relaxing Koala are now faced with the task of writing up a more detailed specification that clearly states the
goals and requirements for the restaurant information system to be developed.
